<p>Asking questions is a very important skill for a developer. However, in your career you won't always have someone to give you all of the answers. Part of being a developer is getting really good&nbsp;at something we call problem solving. It is often the most overlooked skill to&nbsp;practice&nbsp;by a beginner. In this course, we want to work on the skills that matter, so moving forward, I have a request for you that will have long term positive effects on your career:<br><br><strong>If you have a question or you don't understand something,&nbsp;do these things&nbsp;in order:</strong><br><strong>1.</strong> Try Rubber Ducking:&nbsp;<a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://rubberduckdebugging.com/</a> (all great programmers I know do this)<br><strong>2. </strong>Use google and websites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a> (there is a video coming up on this) to find your answer. Most likely somebody has had your issue before.<br><strong>3.</strong> Reach out to our community on Discord (Invite link in lecture 2)&nbsp;where we have lots of smart developers who are there to help you. Learn to communicate and ask questions with fellow developers.&nbsp;<br><br>Still don't have the answer? Go back through step 1~3 and see if you missed something.</p><p>4. If all else fails, look to see if others have posted similar questions in the QA.&nbsp;But keep in mind:&nbsp;<strong>Asking questions on&nbsp;Discord online community will allow your question to be seen by&nbsp;more people,&nbsp;and you can receive a faster reply than on Udemy. It also is better for back and forth dialog to debug code when something isn't working.<br><br></strong>Enough break.&nbsp;Let's get back to some coding!</p>
