<p>Now that you have seen it, it's time for you to break Google as well! Download Google Chrome if you don't have it downloaded yet at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a><br></p><p>Open up the browser and visit any page you want. Then go to <strong>View &gt;&gt; Developer &gt;&gt;&nbsp;Developer Tools</strong>. Select the icon with the mouse and window right at the top left corner of the window that pops up. Now select anywhere on the page and you will get the section of the HTML that has that element. Now press "Delete"<br><br>***<strong>Note: If you are using windows:&nbsp;click on the three (vertical) dots on the top-right corner of the Chrome window. Then "More Tools"&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;"Developer Tools". Thank you for one of the students, David for pointing this out!</strong><br><br>Enjoy playing around with your newly discovered power!</p>
