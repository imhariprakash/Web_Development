primitive type : 

	* single value : undefined(lack of existence) : initially js assigns :can't set a = undefined means we are never going to assign it
	* Null : nothing
	* Boolean : true / false
	* Number : (numeric only has one type for numericals) : floating point
	* String - single / double quotes
	* Symbol (new one ES6) : being constructed not yet supported by most browsers
	
	
operator precedence and associativity(left to right / right to left) : 

Conversion : 

	* Number(undefined) = NaN
	* Number(null) = 0
	* == converts and checks
	* === no conversions (type and value equal)
	* Boolean(undefined) = false
	* Boolean(nan) = false
	* Boolean("") = false
	

default value : 

	name = name || '<Your name here>';
	console.log("Hello " + name);   // careful about 0
	
	say greet() -> Hello <Your name here>
